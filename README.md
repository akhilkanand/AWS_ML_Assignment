# AWS_ML_Assignment

1.	Use Amazon Polly to convert the text “The sun does arise and make happy the skies. The merry bells ring to welcome the spring.” into a mp3 file using the male voice of Mathew. Then use Amazon Transcribe to convert the voice in the mp3 file back into text. Tell us what that text is. Does it exactly match the input text?
You will need to create Amazon S3 buckets for using Amazon Transcribe.
